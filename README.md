# Tweet-Driven Market Reactions

**An event-driven NLP analysis of short-term stock behavior around CEO tweets.**

Financial markets respond not only to earnings and macroeconomic data, but also to narratives — especially when those narratives come from influential corporate leaders.

This project investigates how stock prices, volatility, and trading volume behave around the timing of CEO tweets, using natural language processing, intraday market data, and event-study techniques.

The goal is not price prediction, but to measure **short-term market reactions**, identify patterns, and understand the limits of social-media-driven signals.
